# **Leon - Mini E-Commerce Site**

Welcome to **Leon**, a mini e-commerce website built to showcase my front-end development skills. This project is designed to demonstrate my ability to create a responsive, user-friendly web application using **React** and **Bootstrap**.

## üöÄ **Project Overview**
**Leon** is a fully functional e-commerce website where users can:
- Browse through products
- View product details
- Add products to a shopping cart
- Manage the cart (add/remove items)
- View a summary of their cart

The primary goal of this project was to simulate the essential features of an e-commerce platform while ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**
- **React**: For building a dynamic, component-based front-end
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive and modern UI design
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For functionality and logic
- **CSS**: For custom styling
  
## üéØ **Features**
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens
- **Product Listing**: Displays products in a clean, organized layout
- **Product Details**: Users can click on a product to view detailed information, including a description, price, and an image
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add and remove items from their cart, and the cart updates dynamically
- **Dynamic Data Rendering**: The site is designed to work with a mock product API to display dynamic content
